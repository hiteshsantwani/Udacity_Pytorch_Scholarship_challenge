Phase 1 is the Challenge Course. The duration of this course is two months, and program participants will receive support from community managers throughout their learning experience, as they become part of a dynamic student community and network of scholars.

In Phase 2, the top 300 students (in terms of output and collaboration) from the first phase will earn full scholarships to Udacity’s Deep Learning Nanodegree program, where they’ll cover topics such as: Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Adversarial Networks, Deployment, and more. Students will use PyTorch, and have access to GPUs to train models faster, as they learn from authorities like Sebastian Thrun, Ian Goodfellow, Jun-Yan Zhu, and Andrew Trask.
